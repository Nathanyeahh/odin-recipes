        <h2>Description</h2>
        <p>Slightly more challenging recipe, but not too difficult! It's a bit more technical than the other recipes on my page, but it's a good test of skill in the kitchen according to chefs.</p>
        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
        <ul>
            <li>3 Eggs</li>
            <li>Parsley</li>
            <li>Butter</li>
            <li>Salt & Pepper</li>
        </ul>
        <h2>Steps</h2>
        <ol>
            <li>Crack and whisk 3 eggs in a bowl</li>
            <li>Season your eggs before you whisk</li>
            <li>After whisked, add some butter to the pan on low-medium heat</li>
            <li>Once butter starts to bubble, add your eggs to the pan</li>
            <li>After a solid layer has formed on the sides and bottom, start rolling the omelette shape.</li>
            <li>Be careful with the temperature of the eggs. You don't want any browning.</li>
            <li>Add parsley</li>
        </ol>
